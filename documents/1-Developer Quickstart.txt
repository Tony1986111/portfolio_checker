# Developer Quickstart

This section of the documentation will provide all the essential resources to help you perform basic trading actions on the Polymarket platform. If you're just getting started, you're in the right place.
Everything you need to start building with the Polymarket API is right here. Let's get started.


## Developer Quickstart

## Your First Order

Placing your first order using one of our two Clients is relatively straightforward.
For Python: pip install py-clob-client.
For Typescript: npm install polymarket/clob-client & npm install ethers.
After installing one of those you will be able to run the below code. Take the time to fill in the constants at the top and ensure you're using the proper signature type based on your login method.
Many additional examples for the Typescript and Python clients are available here(TS) and here(Python) .

### Python First Trade

### Typescript First Trade

```python
from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient
from py_clob_client.clob_types import OrderArgs, OrderType
from py_clob_client.order_builder.constants import BUY

host: str = "https://clob.polymarket.com"
key: str = "" #This is your Private Key. Export from https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket or from your Web3 Extension
chain_id: int = 137 #No need to adjust this
POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS: str = '' #This is the address listed below your profile picture when using the Polymarket site.

#Select from the following 3 initialization options to match your login method, and remove any unused lines so only one client is initialized.


### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with an Email/Magic account. If you login with your email use this example.
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=1, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with a Browser Wallet(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc)
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=2, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

### Initialization of a client that trades directly from an EOA. (If you don't know what this means, you're not using it)
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id)

## Create and sign a limit order buying 5 tokens for 0.010c each
#Refer to the API documentation to locate a tokenID: https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/gamma-markets-api/fetch-markets-guide

client.set_api_creds(client.create_or_derive_api_creds()) 

order_args = OrderArgs(
    price=0.01,
    size=5.0,
    side=BUY,
    token_id="", #Token ID you want to purchase goes here. Example token: 114304586861386186441621124384163963092522056897081085884483958561365015034812 ( Xi Jinping out in 2025, YES side )
)
signed_order = client.create_order(order_args)

## GTC(Good-Till-Cancelled) Order
resp = client.post_order(signed_order, OrderType.GTC)
print(resp)
```

In addition to detailed comments in the code snippet, here are some more tips to help you get started.
See the Python example for details on the proper way to initialize a Py-Clob-Client depending on your wallet type. Three exhaustive examples are given. If using a MetaMask wallet or EOA please see the resources here, for instructions on setting allowances.
When buying into a market you purchase a "Token" that token represents either a Yes or No outcome of the event. To easily get required token pairs for a given event we have provided an interactive endpoint here.
Common pitfalls:
- Negrisk Markets require an additional flag in the OrderArgs negrisk=False
- invalid signature error, likely due to one of the following.
- Incorrect Funder and or Private Key
- Incorrect NegRisk flag in your order arguments
- not enough balance / allowance.
- Not enough USDC to perform the trade. See the formula at the bottom of this page for details.
- If using Metamask / WEB3 wallet go here, for instructions on setting allowances.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Token | A token represents a stake in a specific Yes/No outcome in a Market. The price of a token can fluctuate between 0−0 -0−1 based on the market belief in the outcome. When a market resolves, the token associated with the correct prediction can be redeemed for $1 USDC. This is also sometimes called an Asset Id |
| Market | A single event outcome. Corresponds to a pair of CLOB token IDs(Yes/No), a market address, a question ID and a condition ID. |
| Event | A collection of related markets grouped under a common topic or theme. |
| SLUG | A human readable identification for a market or event. Can be found in the URL of any Polymarket Market or Event. You can use this slug to find more detailed information about a market or event by using it as a parameter in the Get Events or Get Markets endpoints. |
| Negative Risk (negrisk) | A group of Markets(Event) in which only one Market can resolve as yes. For more detail see Negrisk Details |
| Central Limit Order Book | The off-chain order matching system. This is where you place resting orders and market orders are matched with existing orders before being sent on-chain. |
| Polygon Network | A scalable, multi-chain blockchain platform used by Polymarket to facilitate on-chain activities(contract creation, token transfers, etc) |

## API Rate Limits


# Developer Quickstart

## API Rate Limits

​
### How Rate Limiting Works

All rate limits are enforced using Cloudflare's throttling system. When you exceed the maximum configured rate for any endpoint, requests are throttled rather than immediately rejected. This means:
- Throttling: Requests over the limit are delayed/queued rather than dropped
- Burst Allowances: Some endpoints allow short bursts above the sustained rate
- Time Windows: Limits reset based on sliding time windows (e.g., per 10 seconds, per minute)

​
### General Rate Limits
