Bridge and swap assets to Polymarket

​
Overview
The Polymarket Bridge API enables seamless deposits between multiple blockchains and Polymarket.
​
USDC.e on Polygon
Polymarket uses USDC.e (Bridged USDC) on Polygon as collateral for all trading activities. USDC.e is the bridged version of USDC from Ethereum, and it serves as the native currency for placing orders and settling trades on Polymarket.
When you deposit assets to Polymarket:
You can deposit from various supported chains (Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Base, etc.)
Your assets are automatically bridged/swapped to USDC.e on Polygon
USDC.e is credited to your Polymarket wallet
You can now trade on any Polymarket market

Get Supported Assets
Retrieve all supported chains and tokens for deposits and withdrawals.

USDC.e on Polygon: Polymarket uses USDC.e (Bridged USDC from Ethereum) on Polygon as the native collateral for all markets. When you deposit assets from other chains, they are automatically bridged and swapped to USDC.e on Polygon, which is then used as collateral for trading on Polymarket.

Minimum Deposit Amounts: Each asset has a minCheckoutUsd field indicating the minimum deposit amount required in USD. Make sure your deposit meets this minimum to avoid transaction failures.
