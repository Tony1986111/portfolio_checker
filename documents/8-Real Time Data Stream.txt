Real Time Data Socket
​
Overview
The Polymarket Real-Time Data Socket (RTDS) is a WebSocket-based streaming service that provides real-time updates for various Polymarket data streams. The service allows clients to subscribe to multiple data feeds simultaneously and receive live updates as events occur on the platform.
Polymarket provides a Typescript client for interacting with this streaming service. Download and view it’s documentation here
​
Connection Details
WebSocket URL: wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com
Protocol: WebSocket
Data Format: JSON
​
Authentication
The RTDS supports two types of authentication depending on the subscription type:
CLOB Authentication: Required for certain trading-related subscriptions
key: API key
secret: API secret
passphrase: API passphrase
Gamma Authentication: Required for user-specific data
address: User wallet address
​
Connection Management
The WebSocket connection supports:
Dynamic Subscriptions: Without disconnecting from the socket users can add, remove and modify topics and filters they are subscribed to.
Ping/Pong: You should send PING messages (every 5 seconds ideally) to maintain connection
​
Available Subscription Types
Although this connection technically supports additional activity and subscription types, they are not fully supported at this time. Users are free to use them but there may be some unexpected behavior.
The RTDS currently supports the following subscription types:
Crypto Prices - Real-time cryptocurrency price updates
Comments - Comment-related events including reactions
​
Message Structure
All messages received from the WebSocket follow this structure:
{
  "topic": "string",
  "type": "string", 
  "timestamp": "number",
  "payload": "object"
}
topic: The subscription topic (e.g., “crypto_prices”, “comments”, “activity”)
type: The message type/event (e.g., “update”, “reaction_created”, “orders_matched”)
timestamp: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
payload: Event-specific data object
​
Subscription Management
​
Subscribe to Topics
To subscribe to data streams, send a JSON message with this structure:

{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "subscriptions": [
    {
      "topic": "topic_name",
      "type": "message_type",
      "filters": "optional_filter_string",
      "clob_auth": {
        "key": "api_key",
        "secret": "api_secret", 
        "passphrase": "api_passphrase"
      },
      "gamma_auth": {
        "address": "wallet_address"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Unsubscribe from Topics
To unsubscribe from data streams, send a similar message with "action": "unsubscribe".
​
Error Handling
Connection errors will trigger automatic reconnection attempts
Invalid subscription messages may result in connection closure
Authentication failures will prevent successful subscription to protected topics
