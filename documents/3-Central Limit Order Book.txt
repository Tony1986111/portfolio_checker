CLOB Introduction
Welcome to the Polymarket Order Book API! This documentation provides overviews, explanations, examples, and annotations to simplify interaction with the order book. The following sections detail the Polymarket Order Book and the API usage.
​
System
Polymarket’s Order Book, or CLOB (Central Limit Order Book), is hybrid-decentralized. It includes an operator for off-chain matching/ordering, with settlement executed on-chain, non-custodially, via signed order messages.
The exchange uses a custom Exchange contract facilitating atomic swaps between binary Outcome Tokens (CTF ERC1155 assets and ERC20 PToken assets) and collateral assets (ERC20), following signed limit orders. Designed for binary markets, the contract enables complementary tokens to match across a unified order book.
Orders are EIP712-signed structured data. Matched orders have one maker and one or more takers, with price improvements benefiting the taker. The operator handles off-chain order management and submits matched trades to the blockchain for on-chain execution.
​
API
The Polymarket Order Book API enables market makers and traders to programmatically manage market orders. Orders of any amount can be created, listed, fetched, or read from the market order books. Data includes all available markets, market prices, and order history via REST and WebSocket endpoints.
​
Security
Polymarket’s Exchange contract has been audited by Chainsecurity (View Audit).
The operator’s privileges are limited to order matching, non-censorship, and ensuring correct ordering. Operators can’t set prices or execute unauthorized trades. Users can cancel orders on-chain independently if trust issues arise.

​
Overview
Fees apply symmetrically in output assets (proceeds). This symmetry ensures fairness and market integrity. Fees are calculated differently depending on whether you are buying or selling:
Selling outcome tokens (base) for collateral (quote):
feeQuote=baseRate×min(price,1−price)×size

Buying outcome tokens (base) with collateral (quote):
feeBase=baseRate×min(price,1−price)×price/size

Clients
Polymarket has implemented reference clients that allow programmatic use of the API below:
clob-client (Typescript):https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client
py-clob-client (Python):https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client

python_initialization

typescript_initialization
pip install py-clob-client

from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient

host: str = ""
key: str = ""
chain_id: int = 137

### Initialization of a client that trades directly from an EOA
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id)

### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with an Email/Magic account
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=1, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with a Browser Wallet(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc)
client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=2, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

​
Order Utils
Polymarket has implemented utility libraries to programmatically sign and generate orders:
clob-order-utils (Typescript):https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-order-utils
python-order-utils (Python):https://github.com/Polymarket/python-order-utils
go-order-utils (Golang):https://github.com/Polymarket/go-order-utils




Authentication
There are two levels of authentication to be considered when using Polymarket’s CLOB.
All signing can be handled directly by the client libraries.
This is information for advanced users who are NOT using our Python or Typescript Clients. Our provided clients handle signing and authentication for you.
​
L1: Private Key Authentication
The highest level of authentication is via an account’s Polygon private key.
The private key remains in control of a user’s funds and all trading is non-custodial.
The operator never has control over users’ funds.
Private key authentication is required for:
Placing an order (for signing the order)
Creating or revoking API keys
​
L1 Header
Header	Required?	Description
POLY_ADDRESS	yes	Polygon address
POLY_SIGNATURE	yes	CLOB EIP 712 signature
POLY_TIMESTAMP	yes	Current UNIX timestamp
POLY_NONCE	yes	Nonce. Default 0
The POLY_SIGNATURE is generated by signing the following EIP-712 struct.
Implementations exist in:
Typescript
Python
​
Signing Example

Python

Typescript
domain = {
    "name": "ClobAuthDomain",
    "version": "1",
    "chainId": chainId,  # Polygon Chain ID 137
}

types = {
    "ClobAuth": [
        {"name": "address", "type": "address"},
        {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string"},
        {"name": "nonce", "type": "uint256"},
        {"name": "message", "type": "string"},
    ]
}

value = {
    "address": signingAddress,  # The signing address
    "timestamp": ts,            # The CLOB API server timestamp
    "nonce": nonce,             # The nonce used
    "message": "This message attests that I control the given wallet",
}

sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value)
​
L2: API Key Authentication
The next level of authentication consists of the API key, secret, and passphrase.
These are used solely to authenticate API requests made to Polymarket’s CLOB, such as posting/canceling orders or retrieving an account’s orders and fills.
When a user on-boards via:
POST /auth/api-key
the server uses the signature as a seed to deterministically generate credentials.
An API credential includes:
key: UUID identifying the credentials
secret: Secret string used to generate HMACs (not sent with requests)
passphrase: Secret string sent with each request, used to encrypt/decrypt the secret (never stored)
All private endpoints require an API key signature (L2 Header).
​
L2 Header
Header	Required?	Description
POLY_ADDRESS	yes	Polygon address
POLY_SIGNATURE	yes	HMAC signature for request
POLY_TIMESTAMP	yes	Current UNIX timestamp
POLY_API_KEY	yes	Polymarket API key
POLY_PASSPHRASE	yes	Polymarket API key passphrase
