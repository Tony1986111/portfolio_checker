Builder Program Introduction
Learn about Polymarket’s Builder Program and how to integrate your platform

​
What is a Builder?
In the context of Polymarket, a “builder” refers to a person, group, or organization that routes orders from their customers to Polymarket. For example, if you’ve created a unique front end that allows your users to place trades on Polymarket via your system, then this guide is for you.
​
Builder Program Benefits
The Builders Program currently provides two main benefits:
​
1. Polygon Relayer Access
We expose our Polygon relayer to builders, allowing you to route on-chain transactions through our infrastructure. This means:
Polymarket pays for gas fees on your behalf (when using our Safe Wallets)
You can deploy Safe Wallets for your users and customers
​
2. Trading Attribution
When posting orders to our CLOB exchange, you can add custom headers that identify you as a builder. This enables Polymarket to clearly attribute orders coming from your platform.
High volume builders will be showcased in our upcoming Builder Leaderboard allowing Builders to compete for grants from Polymarket.
​
Getting Started
Explore the following guides to integrate with the Builders Program:
Builder Keys - Learn how to generate your Builder Keys and manage your builder profile
Order Attribution - Learn how to attribute customer orders to your builder account
Relayer Client - Use the Polygon relayer for gasless transactions and Safe wallet deployment (available in TypeScript and Python)
Builder Signing Server - Set up a secure server for remote signing of builder headers
​
Client Libraries
The Builders Program provides official client libraries in multiple languages:
TypeScript: @polymarket/builder-relayer-client
Python: py-builder-relayer-client
​
Tracking Builder Performance
Monitor builder’s performance programmatically using our Data API:
Leaderboard API - Get aggregated builder rankings for a time period
Volume API - Get daily time-series volume data for trend analysis
You can also view your public profile and stats on the Builder Leaderboard.



Builder Profile & Keys
Learn how to access your builder profile and obtain API credentials

​
Accessing Your Builder Profile
You can access your builder profile settings in your Polymarket Profile when signed in.
You can also navigate to your builder profile by:
Clicking your profile image in the top right corner
Selecting “Builders” from the dropdown menu
​
Builder Profile Settings
Check image (/Users/yedelai/files12345/polymarket/documents/images/1.png)

In your builder profile settings, you can:
​
Customize Your Builder Identity
Profile Picture: Upload a custom image that will represent you on the Builder Leaderboard
Builder Name: Set or update the name that will be displayed publicly on the leaderboard
Your builder profile and stats will be visible to the community on the Builder Leaderboard, where builders compete for grants based on their trading volume.
​
View Your Builder Information
Builder Address: Your unique builder address used to identify your account
Creation Date: When your builder account was created
​
Obtaining Builder API Keys
Builder API keys are required to attribute customer orders to your builder account. These credentials allow you to sign orders and add authentication headers to CLOB requests.
​
Creating API Keys
In the Builder Keys section of your profile, you can:
View your existing API keys with their creation dates and status
Click ”+ Create New” to generate a new API key
Each API key includes:
apiKey: Your builder API key identifier
secret: Secret key for signing requests
passphrase: Additional authentication passphrase
Security Notice: Your Builder API keys must be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code. Store them as environment variables and use remote signing when possible.
​
Managing API Keys
Multiple Keys: You can create multiple API keys for different environments (development, production, etc.)
Active Status: Keys show an “ACTIVE” status when they’re operational
​
Using Your Builder Credentials
Once you have your API keys, you can use them to attribute orders to your builder account. See the Order Attribution guide for detailed implementation instructions.
​

Order Attribution
Learn how to attribute customer orders to your builder account using authentication headers

​
Overview
The order attribution system allows builders to attach custom headers to their customer orders before posting them to the CLOB. These additional headers enable Polymarket to attribute orders to your specific builder account, providing visibility into which orders originate from your platform.
​
Builder API Credentials
Each builder will receive Builder API Key Credentials that look like this:
interface BuilderApiKeyCreds {
    key: string;
    secret: string;
    passphrase: string;
}

// Example structure
const builderCreds = {
    key: "xxxxx.....",
    secret: "xxxxx.....",
    passphrase: "xxxxx....."
};
Security Notice: Your Builder API keys must be kept secure. We provide both local and remote signing methods to help you protect these credentials.
​
Signing Methods
There are two methods available for signing orders and adding attribution headers: Remote Signing and Local Signing.
​
Remote Signing (Recommended)
Remote signing is the recommended approach for protecting your Builder API credentials. With this method, your credentials never leave your secure server.
How it works:
Your customer signs an order payload (ready to be sent to the CLOB)
Instead of sending directly to the CLOB, the signed payload is sent to your builder signing server
Your builder signing server uses your Builder API keys to cryptographically sign the entire payload and adds the authentication headers
The fully signed payload (signed by both your customer and you as the builder) is then sent to the CLOB
Implementation:
We provide a complete server implementation in the @polymarket/builder-signing-server repository.
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Basic remote signing configuration
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

// Or with optional authorization token for added security
const builderConfigWithAuth = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign", token: "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"}
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig // or builderConfigWithAuth
);

// Create and post order - headers are added automatically
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
Remote Builder Configuration:
interface RemoteBuilderConfig {
    url: string;              // URL of your signing server
    token?: string;           // Optional authorization token
}
The optional token parameter allows you to add an authorization header to requests sent to your signing server, providing an additional layer of security.
​
Local Signing
If you control the entire order placement flow (including signing for your customers), you can sign orders locally before sending them to the CLOB.
How it works:
Your system creates and signs the order on behalf of your customer
Your system uses your Builder API credentials locally to add authentication headers
The complete signed order with builder headers is sent directly to the CLOB
Implementation:
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig, BuilderApiKeyCreds } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Configure with local builder credentials
const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
    key: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY!,
    secret: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_SECRET!,
    passphrase: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!
};

const builderConfig: BuilderConfig = {
    localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
};

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig
);

// Create and post order - headers are added automatically
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
​
Authentication Headers
The builder signing process adds the following headers to each order request:
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY: Your builder API key
POLY_BUILDER_TIMESTAMP: Unix timestamp of when the signature was created
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE: Your builder passphrase
POLY_BUILDER_SIGNATURE: HMAC signature of the request
These headers are automatically generated and attached by the SDK - you don’t need to construct them manually.
​
Using Our SDKs
Important: We strongly recommend using our official SDKs and server implementations. You do not need to implement the signing logic yourself.
We provide the following packages to handle all signing and header injection:
@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk: Core signing functionality
@polymarket/builder-signing-server: Production-ready remote signing server
@polymarket/clob-client: Updated CLOB client with built-in builder support
All examples in this documentation use these official packages to ensure security and reliability.
​
Next Steps
Set up your builder signing server for remote signing
Review the complete examples in the CLOB client repository

Builder Signing Server
Self-hosted server for secure remote signing of builder authentication headers

​
Overview
The Builder Signing Server is a self-hosted Express.js application that enables remote signing of builder authentication headers. By running this server, you can keep your Builder API credentials secure on your own infrastructure while still allowing your application to sign requests.
This server is designed to work with both the CLOB Client for order attribution and the Relayer Client for gasless transactions.
​
Why Use Remote Signing?
Remote signing provides enhanced security by:
Isolating credentials: Your Builder API keys never leave your secure server
Centralized key management: Manage credentials in one secure location
Reduced exposure: Client applications don’t need direct access to sensitive keys
​
Installation
​
Prerequisites
Node.js: v18 or higher
yarn or npm
​
Clone and Install
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server.git
cd builder-signing-server

# Install dependencies
yarn install
​
Configuration
​
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with your Builder API credentials:
PORT=5001
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY=your_builder_api_key
POLY_BUILDER_SECRET=your_builder_secret
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE=your_builder_passphrase
Security: Never commit your .env file to version control. Add it to .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure of your credentials.
​
Port Configuration
You can run the server on any port you choose. The default is 5001, but you can change this by setting the PORT environment variable. Make sure to configure your client applications to use the same port:
// In your client application
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});
​
Running the Server
​
Development Mode
For development with automatic reloading:
yarn start-dev
​
Production Mode
Build and run the compiled version:
# Start the production server
yarn start
The server will start and display:
Builder signing server listening on :5001
​
Client Integration
​
With CLOB Client
Configure the CLOB client to use your signing server for order attribution:
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig
);

// Orders will automatically use the signing server
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
​
With Relayer Client
Configure the relayer client to use your signing server for gasless transactions:
import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const relayClient = new RelayClient(
    relayerUrl,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    builderConfig
);

// Transactions will automatically use the signing server
const response = await relayClient.deploySafe();
const result = await response.wait();
​
Production Deployment
​
Troubleshooting
​
Server Won’t Start
Issue: Error: POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY environment variable is required
Solution: Ensure your .env file contains all required variables:
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY
POLY_BUILDER_SECRET
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE
​
Port Already in Use
Issue: Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001
Solution: Change the port in your .env file:
PORT=5002
And update your client configuration accordingly.
​
Invalid Signature Errors
Issue: Client receives invalid signature errors
Solution:
Verify the request body is being passed correctly as a JSON string
Check that the path and method match exactly what the client is sending
Ensure your server and client are using the same Builder API credentials

​
Installation

TypeScript

Python
npm install @polymarket/builder-relayer-client
# or
pnpm install @polymarket/builder-relayer-client
​
Quick Start
​
Relayer URL
The Polymarket relayer is publicly available at:
https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/
​
Basic Setup
The relayer client is available for both TypeScript and Python:

Ethers v5

Viem

Python
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
import { BuilderApiKeyCreds, BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const relayerUrl = process.env.POLYMARKET_RELAYER_URL;
const chainId = 137; // Polygon mainnet

// Create wallet
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

// Configure builder credentials
const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
    key: process.env.BUILDER_API_KEY!,
    secret: process.env.BUILDER_SECRET!,
    passphrase: process.env.BUILDER_PASS_PHRASE!
};

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
});

// Initialize client
const client = new RelayClient(relayerUrl, chainId, wallet, builderConfig);
​
Remote Signing
For enhanced security, you can use remote signing to keep your builder credentials on a secure server:

TypeScript

Python
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const client = new RelayClient(relayerUrl, chainId, wallet, builderConfig);
​
Core Features
​
Deploying Safe Wallets
Deploy a Safe wallet for your user with a single call. Polymarket pays the gas fees:

TypeScript

Python
const response = await client.deploySafe();
const result = await response.wait();

if (result) {
    console.log("Safe deployed successfully!");
    console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.transactionHash);
    console.log("Safe Address:", result.proxyAddress);
} else {
    console.log("Safe deployment failed");
}
​
Setting Token Approvals
Set token allowances to enable trading. This example approves USDC spending for the Conditional Token Framework:

TypeScript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { Interface } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { OperationType, SafeTransaction } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";

// Define ERC20 approval interface
const erc20Interface = new Interface([{
    "constant": false,
    "inputs": [
        {"name": "_spender", "type": "address"},
        {"name": "_value", "type": "uint256"}
    ],
    "name": "approve",
    "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "bool"}],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
}]);

// Create approval transaction
function createApprovalTransaction(
    tokenAddress: string,
    spenderAddress: string
): SafeTransaction {
    return {
        to: tokenAddress,
        operation: OperationType.Call,
        data: erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData("approve", [
            spenderAddress,
            ethers.constants.MaxUint256
        ]),
        value: "0"
    };
}

// Execute the approval
const usdcAddress = "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174";
const ctfAddress = "0x4d97dcd97ec945f40cf65f87097ace5ea0476045";

const approvalTx = createApprovalTransaction(usdcAddress, ctfAddress);
const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions(
    [approvalTx],
    "Approve USDC for CTF"
);

const result = await response.wait();
console.log("Approval completed:", result?.transactionHash);
​
Monitoring Transaction Status
The relayer client provides built-in transaction monitoring:

TypeScript

Python
// Automatic waiting (recommended)
const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions(transactions);
const result = await response.wait();

if (result) {
    console.log("Transaction confirmed:", result.transactionHash);
    console.log("Transaction state:", result.state);
} else {
    console.log("Transaction failed or timed out");
}
​
Transaction States
Transactions move through the following states:
STATE_NEW: Transaction received by relayer
STATE_EXECUTED: Transaction executed on-chain
STATE_MINED: Transaction included in a block
STATE_CONFIRMED: Transaction confirmed (final state)
STATE_FAILED: Transaction failed (terminal state)
STATE_INVALID: Transaction rejected as invalid (terminal state)
​
CTF Operations
The relayer client enables you to execute Conditional Token Framework operations for your users:
​
Split Positions
Split collateral tokens into conditional tokens representing different outcomes:
import { Interface } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { OperationType, SafeTransaction } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";

const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function splitPosition(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"
]);

const splitTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("splitPosition", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        partition,
        amount
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([splitTx], "Split position");
const result = await response.wait();
​
Merge Positions
Merge conditional tokens back into collateral:
const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function mergePositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"
]);

const mergeTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("mergePositions", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        partition,
        amount
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([mergeTx], "Merge position");
const result = await response.wait();
​
Redeem Positions
Redeem winning conditional tokens for collateral after market resolution:
const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function redeemPositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] indexSets)"
]);

const redeemTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("redeemPositions", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        indexSets
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([redeemTx], "Redeem position");
const result = await response.wait();
​
Transaction Metadata
Use descriptive metadata to track transaction purposes:
Metadata is limited to 500 characters or less
await client.executeSafeTransactions(
    transactions,
    "User deposit: 100 USDC for market ABC123"
);
​
TypeScript Types
The relayer client is fully typed. Key types include:
interface SafeTransaction {
    to: string;
    operation: OperationType;
    data: string;
    value: string;
}

enum OperationType {
    Call = 0,
    DelegateCall = 1
}

enum RelayerTransactionState {
    STATE_NEW = "STATE_NEW",
    STATE_EXECUTED = "STATE_EXECUTED",
    STATE_MINED = "STATE_MINED",
    STATE_CONFIRMED = "STATE_CONFIRMED",
    STATE_FAILED = "STATE_FAILED",
    STATE_INVALID = "STATE_INVALID"
}

interface RelayerTransaction {
    transactionID: string;
    transactionHash: string;
    from: string;
    to: string;
    proxyAddress: string;
    data: string;
    state: string;
    type: string;
    metadata: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
}
