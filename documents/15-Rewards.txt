Liquidity Rewards
Polymarket provides incentives aimed at catalyzing the supply and demand side of the marketplace. Specifically there is a public liquidity rewards program as well as one-off public pnl/volume competitions.

​
Overview
By posting resting limit orders, liquidity providers (makers) are automatically eligible for Polymarket’s incentive program. The overall goal of this program is to catalyze a healthy, liquid marketplace. We can further define this as creating incentives that:
Catalyze liquidity across all markets
Encourage liquidity throughout a market’s entire lifecycle
Motivate passive, balanced quoting tight to a market’s mid-point
Encourages trading activity
Discourages blatantly exploitative behaviors
This program is heavily inspired by dYdX’s liquidity provider rewards which you can read more about here. In fact, the incentive methodology is essentially a copy of dYdX’s successful methodology but with some adjustments including specific adaptations for binary contract markets with distinct books, no staking mechanic a slightly modified order utility-relative depth function and reward amounts isolated per market. Rewards are distributed directly to the maker’s addresses daily at midnight UTC.
